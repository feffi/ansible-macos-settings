  # Set hibernate mode:
  # hibernatemode = 0 (binary 0000) by default on supported desktops. The system will not back memory up to
  #   persistent storage. The system must wake from the contents of memory; the system will lose context on
  #   power loss. This is, historically, plain old sleep.
  #
  # hibernatemode = 3 (binary 0011) by default on supported portables. The system will store a copy of mem-ory memory
  #   ory to persistent storage (the disk), and will power memory during sleep. The system will wake from
  #   memory, unless a power loss forces it to restore from disk image.
  #
  # hibernatemode = 25 (binary 0001 1001) is only settable via pmset. The system will store a copy of mem-ory memory
  #   ory to persistent storage (the disk), and will remove power to memory. The system will restore from
  #   disk image. If you want "hibernation" - slower sleeps, slower wakes, and better battery life, you
  #   should use this setting.
